## CONTEXT-BASED IMAGE CAPTIONING

This project is a Context-Based Image Captioning website that leverages computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate context-aware captions for images. The captions are enriched by user-provided contextual inputs, making them more meaningful and specific.

# Features
User-Interactive Website:

Upload images and provide contextual text inputs.
Real-time caption generation using advanced deep learning models.
Multi-Model Comparison:

Four models were evaluated for feature extraction: Xception, ResNet, VGG16, and EfficientNet.
The Xception model performed the best, achieving the highest BLEU score (~60%).
Context Integration:

Allows users to include additional contextual information to enhance the captions generated for uploaded images.
